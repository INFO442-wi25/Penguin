# INFO 340 Project

This repository contains demo-code for the draft of an interactive information web app called "Get To The Trail". It created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

Currently it contains the all the main pages showing the basic layout of the homepage we envisioned.

The pages are:

1. "Home" shows the home page, a universal search bar and some user blog/experience about the trails they went to when scrolled down
2. "Trail" shows the information for each individual routes.  When clicking each individual trail the information of the trail will be show. We also envisioned that the user can update the status of the trail and the user can bookmark the trail.
3. "Shop" shows the possible options of hiking gear that the user can purchase.
3. "User" shows the user details such as name, address and their description. The page also shows their recent activities and friends they made on our website.
