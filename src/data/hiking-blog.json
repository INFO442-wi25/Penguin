    "description":"Enjoy this 4.4-mile loop trail near Seattle, Washington. Generally considered an easy route, it takes an average of 1 h 45 min to complete.",
    "content":"Really beautiful trail, not that many people on it in the morning but it was 30 degrees so there might be more people when it’s warmer. Highly recommend bringing sunglasses because the sun reflects off the water after the lighthouse so it is hard to see and you definitely don’t want to miss those beautiful sights"

    "content":"Trail from Shelby/Hamlin to Foster Island is still OK but getting damp. Will be muddy after more rain. Very pretty through Marsh Island now! Connection to Arboretum is open currently. Trail under the Montlake bridge is an interesting add on. Arboretum is fascinating, even in the late fall!"

The trail is well maintained and there are plenty of benches along the way to rest. There are also a few places to get water along the way. The trail is also dog friendly, so you can bring your pup along for the walk. I would recommend this trail for anyone looking for a quick walk or run."

    "content":"Parking wasn’t a problem at all. Beginning of the trail was in the shade and the ground was frosty, not slippery though. Snow was on the ground near the top, after the West Tiger #3 sign. We had micro spikes but didn’t need them. Trekking poles are highly recommended for descent as these loose rocks and wet wood pieces are slippery."

Definitely some spots away from traffic noise, but few spots not within earshot of a couple of roosters experiencing existential crises. Overall a nice stretch of the legs."
