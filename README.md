Most useful feedback:
The overall project is very interesting and creative, but the requirements should be more clear and more progressive.

What actions will you be taking?
We plan to improve our requirements based on the functions we will use on AWS to help others understand how our goal is getting accomplished step by step.

One technique you learned
We can use Figma to create an expected visual output first, then finish the project step by step.
