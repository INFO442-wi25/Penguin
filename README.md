# Reflection
- What was the most useful feedback that your group recieved?
The groups that we worked with told us that our project was interesting since its a project that is beyond the scope of the major. We could improve upon our architecture, sincd our type of architecture for the project did not fit with it.

- Thinking about your own role in your gorup, which actions will you be taking based on that feedback?
The actions I will take is to actively communicate with my teammate about the architecture and see if everyone agrees with the architecture.

- Focusing on the other projects that you saw in class what is one technology tool that you learned about and may want to try the future?
  A lot of projects used figma to work on their aops. One group used only a text-based UI for creating their app (need to research on this more).
